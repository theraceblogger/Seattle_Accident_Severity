# Predicting Accident Severity in Seattle

This project uses data from Seattle's Department of Transportation to train a machine learning algorithm to predict injury in future accidents. After importing the data and analyzing it with charts and graphs, the data is prepared for machine learning by dealing with missing values, encoding, normalizing, undersampling, categorizing and feature selection. I have used 5 types of classifiers: logistic regression, decision tree, k-nearest neighbors, random forest and support vector machine. K-nearest neighbors performed the best with 69% accuracy. I conclude with the factors that contribute to whether an accident will have injury or not, and ideas for a safer Seattle.
